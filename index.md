# Meng Fotobox by B. Cloos

This page shows my DIY-project of a photobooth.

## Information

*MengFotobox* is a private DIY project of Ben Cloos. The project consists of a DYI photobooth, parties, marriages, birthdays, hollidays or other events. 
This project was started in 2018. Professional Photobooths for such events are usually costly, although very easy to handle.
The goal of this project is, to create a low-cost, photobooth station, where the only recurring costs would be the photopaper for when pictures want to be printed out directly.

## MengFotoboy1.0

In the beginning of this project, the first approach was very simple. The used hardware was the following:
* Laptop with the software [DSLRBooth](https://dslrbooth.com/)
* DSLR Camera (in this case NikonD5100)
* Cables

The laptop was put on a high table, the camera behind it on a tripod. Very easy setup.

## MengFotobox2.0

In this version of the project, the processing unit of the photobooth was changed completely. The Laptop was changed with an iPad Mini.
Hard- and Software:
* iPad Mini with the software [WiFiBooth](www.wifibooth.com)
* DSLR Camera (in this case [Canon 7Dmkii](https://www.canon.de/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_7d_mark_ii/))
* Cables
* Aluminium Box, with cutouts for iPad and DSLR inside -> [Link](https://www.printables.com/model/64961-diy-photobooth) 
* Softbox Lights from Neewer --> [Link](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B01CVGWALM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

This version of *MengFotobox* worked well for several years, until some iPadOS and the age of the iPad made the system really slow. 

## MengFotobox3.0 (current setup)

In April 2023, the next version of *MengFotobox* started development. 
iPads are expensive, even when they are bought used, so the decision was made to change to a computer-based system. The software [Sparkbooth](https://sparkbooth.com/) offers a comnputer-based solution as a photobooth application.
Although the application is not cheap at a pricetag of 150â‚¬ for the DSLR version, this software was the most suiting one, because of the one-time fee.
